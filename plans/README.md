- **[progress.md](./progress.md)** - Real-time progress tracking and current status

### **Living Documentation System**
These documents are designed to be updated continuously as the project progresses:

#### **📈 Progress Tracking**
- Current sprint objectives
- Phase completion percentages  
- Task status (completed, in-progress, pending)
- Blocker identification and resolution

#### **🧠 Project Memory**
- Technical decisions made and pending
- Architecture insights and learnings
- Code organization principles
- Important context for future development

#### **🎯 Strategic Planning**
- Priority management (ZMK first, others secondary)
- Success metrics and milestones
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Resource and timeline planning

## 🔄 How to Use This System

### **Before Each Development Session:**
1. Review `progress.md` for current status
2. Check `master-plan.md` for context and next steps
3. Update current objectives in `progress.md`

### **During Development:**
- Update progress checkboxes as tasks complete
- Note any technical insights or decisions made
- Document blockers or issues encountered

### **After Each Development Session:**
- Update completion percentages
- Move completed items to "completed tasks"
- Set objectives for next session
- Note any architecture or design insights

## 📝 Document Maintenance

### **Update Frequency:**
- **progress.md**: Updated every development session
- **master-plan.md**: Updated when major decisions are made or architecture changes

### **Version Control:**
All planning documents are version controlled with the rest of the project, providing a complete history of planning decisions and progress over time.
