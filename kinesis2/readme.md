TODO:
- add mapping for what is the naming of each of the keys in kinesis speak. We are going to use QMK's keycodes for encode
- need to get the querty default layout since this is what is used to as the starting point. We can think of this as layer zero which is then edited. We could even use the same idea of transparent for any key that does not need any changes. 
   - If we use the layer idea which the layer 0 being the default layer then we will have three layer total. original, actual, and numberpad layer. Only planning to support Querty base layout layout.
